            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Impossible. This was the word that Swift’s first chief engineer, Ichiro Suzuki, heard countless
                times when he
                shared the ambitious targets he wanted to achieve with the vehicle he was crafting.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In every targeted measure of performance, it would be a vehicle that was superior to even the
                best on the
                road. It would also combine comfort with performance, to be both calming and invigorating.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;This pioneering spirit resulted in the LS 400, a car that made waves in the automotive world when
                it debuted,
                and cemented the Swift name in history.</p>

            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Making the best vehicles and experiences isn’t enough. “How can we make this better?” is a common refrain in Lexus, as we are always looking for ways to make what we do, even better.</p>
